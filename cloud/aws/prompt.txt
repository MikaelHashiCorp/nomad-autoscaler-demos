This task is to modify the terraform deployment so that, along side linux clients being deployed, windows clients can be deployed.  The code needs to be modified so that terraform.tfvars is updated with windows_client_instance type and windows_client_count and windows_ami.  The goal is that Terraform will treat windows clients like linux clients, including AWS autoscaling.  AWS will create, on the fly, two AMIs, one for Windows, one for Linux, then use them for creating the requested instances (from terraform.tfvars) and linking them (HCL configuations) for Nomad and Consul operations as Nomad Servers, Nomad Clients, Consul Servers, Consul Clients.  terraform.tfvars will be the primary source of truth for variables and variables.pkr.hcl will be teh secondary source of truth.  When "Terraform Destroy" is run, like it now deletes the Linux AMI used for that "terraform apply" so it will also destory the Windows AMI.  The same options for default and select AMI that is for LInux AMI applies to the Windows AMI.  

Remember, refresh your memory from copilot-instructions and bob-instructions, along with taking lessons learned along the path to our goal and update the *-instructions.md.  Note that copilot-instructions are for any LLM, bob-instructions are what is need for specific Bob IBM IDE.  For example, logcmd is only needed in bob-instructions, not copilot-instructions, as copilot does executions differently.

One question I have is how do we handle both linux client autoscaling and windows autoscaling?  Any suggestions?
